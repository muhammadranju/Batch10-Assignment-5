                Aid for Injured in the Quota Movement
              </h2>
              <p class="text-lg font-light">
                The recent Quota Movement, a nationwide protest in Bangladesh
                demanding a fair quota system for government jobs, has been
                marked by both peaceful demonstrations and violent clashes. Many
                individuals, including students, activists, and ordinary
                citizens, have sustained injuries during these protests. The
                injuries range from minor bruises to severe wounds, and some
                individuals have even lost their lives. Providing aid to the
                injured is a crucial step in supporting the victims of the Quota
                Movement and ensuring their well-being. Medical assistance,
                including treatment for injuries, medication, and rehabilitation
                services, is essential for the recovery of those affected.
                Additionally, financial assistance can help alleviate the
                economic burden faced by injured individuals and their families.
                By providing aid, we can demonstrate solidarity with the victims
                of the movement and contribute to their physical and emotional
                healing. Furthermore, supporting the injured can help to raise
                awareness.

              <p class="text-lg font-light">
                The conflict in the Gaza Strip is taking a catastrophic toll on
                children. More than 14,000 children have reportedly been killed,
                according to the latest estimate by the Palestinian Ministry of
                Health; thousands more have been injured. There are no safe
                spaces. All of Gaza’s children have been exposed to the
                traumatic experiences of war, the consequences of which will
                last a lifetime. Around 1.9 million people – about 9 in 10 of
                Gaza’s population – are estimated to have been internally
                displaced. Half of them children. They do not have enough access
                to water, food, fuel and medicine.
